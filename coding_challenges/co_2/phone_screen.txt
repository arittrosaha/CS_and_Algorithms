technical:

1
given an array with duplicates elements (any data type). sometimes more than 1 unique ones. how do you return the very first unique

first try
first pass - counter_hash 
second pass - look for the unique with 1 frequency

second try
hash with no counter but tracking index. update to the latest index

2
given singly linked list. but sometimes, a node will have a next and a down like it will fork to a different linkedlist. It is possible for the down ll to have more branches
how do you flattened them prioritizing the down and then next?

recursive tail 
but iterative better

430 leet code - a little different because it deals with doubly linked

3 
For a given string, there will be different types of parentheses: {}, (), and []. Return true or false if the string is balanced properly: all opening parenthesis must be closed with its respective closing parenthesis and in order.

4 
For a given array of numbers, return the pair of numbers with the least absolute difference.



non-technical:
- talking about projects
- question to ask them - bring up volunteering
- I looked at your resume. Which projects do you think relate to the work that we do at Bloomberg?
- did you perform any unit testing on your fullstack.
