Why Bloomberg?
- Bloomberg is up to par with a lot of other technology companies. 
- Crossroads of Finance, Technology, and Data
- Since I am applying, I am interested in the world of technology and data, in which Bloomberg is a leading organization. 
- However, I am not only interested in what Bloomberg does, but I am also interested in how it does it, and that is with transparency and with a focus on people, whether that is employees, clients or consumers.
- The focus on Philanthropy, Environmental and Economic Sustainability was the real draw for me, and why I may prefer Bloomberg over other tech companies.
    - Volunteer opportunities
    - 85% of Bloomberg’s profits go into philanthropy
- Bloomberg training and enough freedom to select your own team to work for.
- Until now I never got a chance to work on finance-related software. 
- Bloomberg terminal can be an exciting thing for me to work on because I like to deal with huge data, scaling issues and low-level stuff.
  Focus on continuous learning through many in-house training programs.
  (Training consists of lectures, labs and group projects. In-house training staff) 
  I’ve heard about classes on stock trading.
- Focus on optimization. I developed a love for optimized code and I’m very excited to learn C++ or even Rust if Bloomberg decides to adopt it in the future.
- Volunteer opportunities.
- Amazing healthcare in BWELL. It seems like Bloomberg really cares for the wellbeing of its employees. 
- Free access to almost all museums in NYC.

Questions to ask Interviewer
- What have you done to utilize Bloomberg’s support for its employees to do philanthropic work?
    I want to do more hands-on volunteer work. (I have a tendency to only feel accomplished the more I exert myself physically)
- What are the best qualities of successful people in this position?
    Due to the cut-throat environment that exists in the FinTech industry, how important is optimized and maintainable code?
- If you were to give me an offer, what would I have done specifically to be considered successful?
- If you were to give me an offer, and I was to accept it, what would be the biggest surprise within the first week?
- What do you think are the benefits of Bloomberg utilizing a flat hierarchy?
